Running Grunt
-------

When you checkout a branch, open up a new tab and run the command `grunt` to
kick-off a process to automatically:
* lint your changes to JavaScript files
* run the defined tests that are withing the `test/` folder
* restart the server when server-related files change

Please make sure there are not errors before pushing changes.
